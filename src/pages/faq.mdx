### who are you? what do you do?
I'm pillow and I like to draw on the internet.  
I am an adult, and I am from Sweden.

### why do you have me blocked on $&#123;socialmedia&#125;?
I probably don't like you.

### why are you not on Twitter anymore?

### can you draw me something?
If I have slots open.  
[**Check out my artistree.io page for more information.**](https://artistree.io/yummypillow " ")

### no i mean like for free
fuck off

### can i draw you something?
You can if you want to, but you really don't need to. If you do, [**send it to me over e-mail.**](mailto:yummypillow.art@gmail.com)

And also, thank you. Very much.

___

### can I commission you through Discord or Bluesky DMs?
**No.**  

The issue with taking commissions this way is that it forces me to put more time and effort into organizing requests,
when that time instead could be used to _actually draw._

I use **artistree.io** which automates a lot of things like invoices through Stripe, organizing your references, and
e-mail notifications over eventual changes. From my point of view, **it is strictly better.**
It also requires no sign-up on the user's end.

I understand that certain people may want to have a direct line of contact with the artist they're commissioning, but
I am a busy person who needs to organize their time. I kindly ask for your patience.

### why did you deny my request?
I reserve the right to deny any request I can't/won't take, for any reason. You are free to send other requests, but
don't send the same one over and over.

### i wanna give you money, but not commission you!
I appreciate the generosity. [**You can do so on my Ko-Fi.**](https://ko-fi.com/K3K64IH80 " ")

### why do you not take PayPal?
I do not trust them. 

I understand that's a stupid point given that trusting large corporations with handling your money is stupid
to begin with, but PayPal has had an exceptionally rocky history in terms of anonymity, fee handling, 
inaccurate market rates and bad customer support.

I understand that you may prefer it over card/Stripe—or possibly don't even have any other option—but it's a liability I'm not
willing to deal with until I'm offering my services under a company name or similar. I apologize for the inconvenience.

### i want to be your friend!
Horrible idea. I'm the meanest person on earth, and I'm bad at responding to people.  
If that sounds great to you, add me on Discord and we can figure it out from there.

### can i join your discord?
In short, **I don't have one.**

In long, running a community that revolves around _me_ isn't something that I feel like doing. I've never been one
for wanting to gain popularity, and running a place where I'm the centerpiece goes right against that. If anything I'd
rather be joining **your** Discord instead.

___

### can i use your work for commercial purposes?
[**E-mail me about it,**](mailto:yummypillow.art@gmail.com " ") and we'll work together from there.

### can i use your work for anything osu!-related?
