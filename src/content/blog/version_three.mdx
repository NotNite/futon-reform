## hey. again.

Happy late Valentine's Day, if you celebrate. Usually I never mention it cuz it isn't a holiday I bother to think about. 
*(outside of the cheap ass chocolate lol.)*  
But the spirit of companionship is a nice one and celebrating the ones you have 
close to you is undeniably worth doing.

Like the way me and procrastination have been together for the last 13 years or so.

For as long as I've been burdened with *responsibilities*, the one thing I've always been able to predict and anticipate is
doing everything as late as possible, as fast as possible, while very actively trying to repress the thoughts of any potential consequences.

Except for uh. Well. ***This.***

This website rewrite took me about **3 months** or so. In that time I've gotten a new drawing tablet, opened commissions,
nearly beat every challenge deck in Balatro, picked up another character in Street Fighter and (most importantly) gotten laid off.

That's a far cry from the kid who nearly failed English class despite being fluent at it just because they didn't wanna turn in the homework.
*Go me, motherfucker.*

## learn how to code stupid, stupid.

So with the preamble out of the way, let's all ask the age old question â€” ***what prompted this change?***

And the answer, just like last time, is **the old site sucked shit.**

What's the deal there? If you read the old blogpost I've *reluctantly* archived from when the first rewrite was brought upon this
domain, there's a real sense of pride in the text that can only come from the highest point of the Dunning-Kruger line. 
I was real proud of what I had managed to accomplish at that point, cuz it looked pretty nice all things considered.

Of course, the tiny little detail I had missed out on was the fact that the backend was a hodgepodge of
shotgun-trial-and-error measuring, `position: absolute;` and a complete lack of understanding what
[Astro](https://astro.build ' ') is capable of. And I guess the typography was all over the place too.

That reared it's head *really damn fast* when I started having ideas for more features for the site. I suddenly did
not find myself wanting to even touch the codebase!

So despite the fact that the website *looks* nice, I decided to hell with it and went for a full-on rewrite, this time
with some rules in mind;
- One unified layout for the entire site as a whole.
- Make page creation as easy as possible.
- Don't put literally **all** the styling in a single CSS file.

Yes I really did do that last one. It's as bad as you can imagine.  
The rules were mostly inspired by the website of coding whiz (and good friend) **[NotNite,](https://notnite.com " ")**
whose simple website with a single layout made it a no-brainer to go for something just as easy for the mind... just a bit
fancier.

With all that in mind, and several months of brainstorming later, we are now here. So let's run through the changes.

## friday night at the bar.

The sidebar is the centerpiece of the entire site.  
Everything from site pages to external links are accessible just by clicking the left side of the screen. (Or Esc if you have Javascript enabled.)

That alone makes the website look cleaner. I didn't want to go for a generic hamburger menu, so I made something that I feel
is unique enough, while still as
